# FreeIPA Community Portal #

The FreeIPA Community Portal is a web application that acts as a portal through which anonymous users can interact with a FreeIPA server for purposes such as self-service registration.

A complete overview of the rationale and architecture of the Community Portal can be found at [FreeIPA design page](http://www.freeipa.org/page/V4/Community_Portal).

# Current State #
This project is currently abandoned. There are now other ideas on how this functionality can be accomplished.

If you are interested in this functionality and want to move forward please indicate your interest on the [freeipa-users mailing list](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/freeipa-users@lists.fedorahosted.org/) and we can discuss next steps.
