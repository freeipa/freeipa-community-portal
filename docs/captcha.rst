The CAPTCHA
===========

Overview
--------

Several forms on the Community Portal site have the potential for abuse. A
warped-characters captcha forms the first line of defense against automated
spam. While probably not sufficient to ward off a determined and sophisticated
adversary, the captcha will deter untargeted, drive-by spam and casual
targetted attacks.


Use Cases
---------

A captcha is present on each form with the potential for abuse, namely the
self-service user registration form and the password reset initiation form. The
password reset completion form is probably not susceptible to abuse and does
not need a captcha.

Design
------

1.) The user requests a form protected with a captcha. 

2.) A random string of 4 characters is generated. The string is fed to the
python captcha library, which returns a BytesIO object representing the captcha
image, which is then turned straightaway into a bytes object. The string is
also mixed with a secret key to form an HMAC string. The HMAC and a timestamp
are stored in a database.

3.) The image, as a data-uri, and the HMAC string, as a hexidecimal text
string, are sent to the client as part of the web form being protected. The
HMAC is placed into a hidden form field to be submitted with the form. The user
solves the captcha and enters the solution into a field in the protected form.
The form is submitted by the user.

4.) Before any processing is done on form data, the captcha is verified by
mixing the user's solution with the secret key from step 2 and compared
securely to the HMAC. If the two match, a correct solution has been found. The
HMAC is then looked up in the database and, if found, is deleted, regardless of
a correct solution or not, to prevent multiple attempts at the same captcha.

5.) If the solution does not match the HMAC or the HMAC is not found in the
database, the user is returned to the form and informed that their captcha
solution is incorrect. If the captcha is correct, processing of form data
begins and the rest of the form's workflow is carried out.

Implementation
--------------

The captcha system depends on a python library called captcha, which does not
current appear to be available in the Fedora package repos, but is available
through pip. 

Old captcha data will be periodically expired and deleted from the database
with a script run regularly by cron. 

Feature Management
------------------

The secret key for the HMAC is currently hard-coded into the program, but will
be read from a configuration file in the future. 

How to Test
-----------

Automated unit tests will be written.
